\begin{abstract}
	How the brain works still remains a mystery and attracts researchers from various areas attempting to understand it.
	Nowadays, the exciting reports of the beating-human visual recognition and decision making have brought deep learning into the spotlight.
	It provides a clue which may unveil the mechanism of neural processing in the brain.
	Therefore, it becomes a hot topic to train and operate deep learning on spiking neural networks(SNN) underline the more biologically realistic way.
	This paper proposed a supervised learning rule to train the Autoencoders of spiking neurons using Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP).
	A network of two-layer Autoencoders was trained on the MNIST database with Integrate-and-Fire (IF) neurons.
	This results demonstrate the equivalent recognition capability comparing to the non-spiking implementations and validate the training ability of the learning rule .

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the most promising research field in computer vision, even exceeding human-level performance on image classification tasks~\cite{he2015delving}.
To investigate whether brains might work similarly on vision tasks, these powerful DNN models have been converted to spiking neural networks (SNNs).
In addition, the spiking DNN offers the prospect of neuromorphic systems that combine remarkable performance with energy-efficient training and operation.

Theoretical studies have shown that biologically-plausible learning, e.g. Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP), could approximate a stochastic version of powerful machine learning algorithms	~\cite{nessler2013bayesian,neftci2013event,neftci2013event,o2016deep}.
such as Expectation Maximization~\cite{nessler2013bayesian}, 
Contrastive Divergence~\cite{neftci2013event}, Markov Chain Monte Carlo~\cite{buesing2011neural} and Gradient Descent~\cite{o2016deep}.
Stochasticity, in contrast with the continuously differentiable functions used by ANNs, is intrinsic to the event-based spiking process, making network training difficult.

state-of-the-art of learning on SNN\cite{ponulak2010supervised,neftci2013event,burbank2015mirrored}

%TODO rewording
Figure~\ref{fig:AE} shows a simplest architecture of an autoencoder, which is the same as a multilayer perceptron (MLP).
The only difference lies to the number of the output units, where an autoencoder has as many output neurons as the input.
In this example, the input layer feeds forward the data vector $\mathbf{v}$ to the hidden layer as weighted sum of the data, $\mathbf{net\_h}$.
Then the hidden units are activated by the input $\mathbf{net\_h}$ according to the activation function: $\mathbf{h}=\sigma(\mathbf{net\_h})$.
Finally, using the same approach the output of the network is generated, $\mathbf{v'}=\sigma(\mathbf{net\_v'})$, as the reconstruction of the input data.
Thus, autoencoders are trained without given target values, work as unsupervised learning models.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{AE}
	\caption{A typical Autoencoder structure.}
	\label{fig:AE}
\end{figure}

%TODO why tied weights are good
Notice that the connections used in the example are tied weights.
\begin{equation}
h_j=\sigma(\sum_i v_i w^T_{ij})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
v'_j=\sigma(\sum_i h_i w_{ij})
\end{equation}

Training an autoencoder is not different from backpropagation (BP) on an Multi-Layer Perceptrons(MLP).
The objective of training is to minimise the prediction error of an MLP, which measured as a loss function.
Accordingly, the loss function of an autoencoder can be described as:
\begin{equation}
L=\sum_{k=1}^{K}\|\mathbf{v}_{k}-\mathbf{v'}_{k}\|=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{K}(\mathbf{v}_{k}-\mathbf{v'}_{k})^{2}
\end{equation}
where k indicates the index of the training data $\mathbf{v}$, and each data vector $\mathbf{v}=\{v_0, v_1,...,v_N\}$ and its reconstruction $\mathbf{v'}=\{v'_0, v'_1,...,v'_N\}$ have N dimensions. 

%TODO rewording
Backpropagation, an abbreviation for "backward propagation of errors", is a common method of training artificial neural networks used in conjunction with an optimization method such as gradient descent.
The method calculates the gradient of a loss function with respect to all the weights in the network.
The gradient is fed to the optimisation method which in turn uses it to update the weights, in an attempt to minimize the loss function:
\begin{equation}
\Delta W \propto -\frac{\partial L}{\partial W}.
\end{equation}

Applying stochastic gradient descent (SGD), the true gradient of the weight matrix, $\Delta W$, is approximated by a gradient at a single example with iterations.
The reconstruction error $E_k$ of an input vector $\mathbf{v}_k$ is as given:
\begin{equation}
%	\begin{align*}
E_k = \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{v}_k - \mathbf{v'}_k)^2,
%	\end{align*}
\end{equation}
and the gradient of the weight matrix is:
\begin{equation}
\Delta W \propto -\frac{\partial E_k}{\partial W}=-\eta \frac{\partial E_k}{\partial W},
\end{equation}
where $\eta$ is the learning rate.

Since we use tied weights in the network, the weight tuning only needs to apply in the output layer.
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\Delta w_{ij} = -\eta \frac{\partial E_k}{\partial w_{ij}} &= -\eta \frac{\partial E_k}{\partial v'_j} \frac{\partial v'_j}{\partial net\_v'_j} \frac{\partial net\_v'_j}{\partial w_{ij}}, \textrm{ where} \\
\frac{\partial E_k}{\partial v'_j} &= \frac{\partial \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{v}_k - \mathbf{v'}_k)^2}{\partial v'_j}= -(v_j - v'_j), \\
%	\frac{\partial v'_j}{\partial net\_v'_j} &= \begin{cases} 1, v'_j>0\\0, v'_j<=0\\ \end{cases}, \textrm{using ReLU,}\\
\frac{\partial v'_j}{\partial net\_v'_j} &= 1, \textrm{using Identify function,}\\
\frac{\partial net\_v'_j}{\partial w_{ij}} &= \frac{\partial h_i w_{ij}}{\partial w_{ij}} = h_i.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Thus, the weight gradient is calculated as:
\begin{equation}
\Delta w_{ij} = \eta h_i(v_j - v'_j) = \eta (h_i v_j - h_i v'_j)
\end{equation}
For RBMs:
\begin{equation}
\Delta w_{ij} = \eta (h_i v_j - h'_i v'_j)
\end{equation}
Energy of an Antoencoder:
\begin{equation}
H = \sum_{i}\sum_{j} v_i w_{ij} h_j.
\end{equation}
Examples of using an autoencoder with 10 input neurons and 10 hidden neurons: reconstruction the input data $\mathbf{v}$ where I) $v_i = 1$, II) $v_i = i/10$.
